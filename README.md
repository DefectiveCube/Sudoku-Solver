# Sudoku-Solver
I got bored and curious one day, and a solution for solving sudoku puzzles came to mind.

Currently, this application can solve a respectable amount of puzzles (i.e. easy to most medium difficulty puzzles).

The application checks for the following:

* Only Choice
* Single Possibility
* Only Square

More advanced strategies are yet-to-be implemented.
